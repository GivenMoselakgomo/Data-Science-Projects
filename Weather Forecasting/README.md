🌦️ Weather Project (WTTR.in Method)

A simple, beginner-friendly Python project that fetches real-time weather information using the free wttr.in weather service.
This project does not need an API key, does not scrape websites, and works with only one dependency: requests.

The program can:

✔ Detect your city automatically using your IP
✔ Get a short one-line weather summary
✔ Get a full ASCII 2-day weather forecast
✔ Allow manual city input
✔ Run entirely from a single Python file
